In the previous 12 state championships (WI, IN, IL, KY, WV) we've entered over they years, we've had 7 secons and 3 3rd place Inspire Award nominations, but never first until this year.  In the last 3 NSR's we were a captain once and 1st pick last year.  We can't wait to play with this awesome level of competition this year!
